##Status report

I'm missing having persistence in my app so today I went through the [5 min Firebase tutorial](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/#gettingstarted). It was very easy to follow and now I've set up a Firebase account for myself. 

I did a GET request to try it out and it was completely wonderful. Easy and intuitive.
