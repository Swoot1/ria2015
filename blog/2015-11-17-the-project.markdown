##The Project

I've decided to make a track your co-worker page. Since I'm working at a consulting firm (yes, I'm an as they call in folkmun "konsultj√§vel") my co-workers are just about everywhere in the world. It would be nice to at least know where my co-workers in Gothenburg are located so that's the plan. A co-worker tracker. I didn't even have to come up with the idea myself. It's already on the agenda at work due date = "when we have time".

I've started to fiddle with react-google-maps but slowpoke is slow and I haven't gotten that far yet.
