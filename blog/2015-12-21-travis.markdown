##Travis you're way too easy

I wanted to write a long blog post on how I implemented Travis but that would be making stuff up. It was simple to add so I'll try to keep it short.

###What is Travis?
Travis is a build tool like Jenkins or Atlassian Bamboo and is used for running tests, linting and deploying your code automatically when you push your code to your repo.

###How do I get started?
Start an account and go through the [getting started page](https://travis-ci.org/getting_started) at [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org). The travis-ci.org is free for open source. Get a paid account at travis-ci.com if you want to be private and not write open source.

###I did it this way
You can check out my (.travis.yml)[https://github.com/Swoot1/ria2015/blob/gh-pages/.travis.yml] if you'd like. While writing this all I do with Travis is to run eslint which you can see in the test script in package.json.

###The most important part
Bravo, good job! Now add the small little badge you can see at some people's readmes to your github readme. Follow the instructions on (this page)[https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images/].

###Further Reading
If you want to be king of kings at using Travis you should check out [Rasmus blog post](https://rasmus.eneman.eu/continuous-integration-and-deployment-to-gh-pages/) where he writes about deploying the code to gh-pages automagically.
