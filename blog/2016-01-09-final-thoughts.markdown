##Final thoughts

I've really enjoyed this course and liked the course structure. You always learn more if you know that you have to write it down and explain it to others as well. Writing suits me but I also feel it suits me a little to well especially when I was writing more than I was coding which was a bit unnecessary. 

Somehow I don't think that the Slack channel worked. Most of the posts in it is from maybe four or five members of the course. It felt as a very friendly chat so I'm not sure why I didn't want to write in it and I don't have any good suggestions on what to do different/instead so I guess that makes my critique invalid.

I liked it when David smashed my pr which made me rethink my coding decisions.

I'm pleased with my own effort and I've learned a lot e.g. ES6, Browserify, Webpack, TypeScript, Angular 2, React, React-Router.

I liked the setup with the guild page which made it "easy" to get going with pr:s and react. I would have preferred if the demo-app was part of the guild repo since I was to lazy to change between the projects in my IDE.
