##Active links y'all

Once upon a time there was a pure React Menu in a school project in a land far, far away where they fika a lot. Links were \<Link\>s and IndexLinks were \<IndexLink\>s and React was working behind the scene setting the right active class on the a tags in the menu. The dictator ruled the land with a Swedish iron hand and there was peace and order.

##But, a new day came \*roaster screaming kuckeliku in the far distance\*

Oh noes! The people of the land have discovered there's bootstrap for React (and not a single line of css was written since). Change is inevitable!

##Fastforward to present time

The much loved menu was replaced with a [react bootstrap menu.](https://github.com/krawaller/riaguild2015/pull/100/files) The brilliant student who whose name I've forgotten used the History mixin to cope with the loss of the "automagi" for the activeLinks that came with the change to Bootstrap.

##Brace yourself!

##More change is coming!

##Wait for it...

[BAAAM](https://github.com/krawaller/riaguild2015/pull/118/files) Once again the menu has been rewritten by another brilliant student and now there's a new player in town, react-router-bootstrap, which comes with the sought for features \<LinkContainer/> and \<IndexLinkContainer\> which deals with active link problem in a new way.

*To be continued..*

I really have to go to bed now. (That's not part of the story). Anyway, David wanted me and MoombaDS to compare the three versions of the menu so here it goes. 

I would have gone with version 1 as far as possible. But since I'm diagnosed with the illness damnbadatdesign as far as possible would have been until I added a css framework. Which would probably be in the second commit or so. 

The reason to why I would have chosen no 1 is because it's the easiest one. It checks what link is active for you and it's built in so the risk of it breaking in the next React version is pretty small. 

I'd say version 2 and 3 is more or less the same except that version 3 is in it's own framework. Since I was upgrading AngularJS at work from version 1.2.something to 1.4.7 last week I have a rather pessimistic view on frameworks right now. Things break! The get outdated and people stop caring for them. It doesn't help if the framework hasn't been updated after every new release. So I'd say 2 comes before 3. Unless! The feature was very special and hard/long to do and the framework contained more functionality I needed, there's a great community around it that you can see is active or it's a school work where the important part is that you learn something.

[David](http://blog.krawaller.se/riaguild2015/#/member/krawaller): Oh, going to bed was a huge mistake, Elin - your tireddrunkedness was evidently at a perfect [Ballmer Peak level](https://xkcd.com/323/) and you would have written something *truly great* had you continued. Now you'll spend the rest of your life fruitlessly trying to calibrate yourself to find the peak again...
