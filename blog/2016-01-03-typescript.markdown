##Why I didn't choose TypeScript as my deep dive project

###What is TypeScript

It's something you should use if you don't like JavaScript.

TypeScript is a programming language where you can write regular JavaScript but also use fancy stuff such as classes, modules, interfaces, typed variables and inheritance. 

\- But wait what? Can you run this in a browser? 
\- No you can't. 

This is where the good part comes in. TypeScript can and should be compiled into regular JavaScript.

###Why not have TypeScript as a project?

I was thinking about doing TypeScript as my final project but I realized that TypeScript isn't that complicated. You can actually learn most of it in an evening. 

If you go through the [tutorial](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Tutorial) on the TypeScript page and check out their [examples](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground) your all set and practically a TypeScript ninja. I really encourage you to do it.

If you want to listen to the example on their homepage with good enough english you can check out [my recording on youtube](https://youtu.be/HY6gRE7Xa90).
