##About
Hello! My name is Elin, I'm 25 years old and have been a developer for some years. I recently moved to Gothenburg and since then I've been working as a Java and JavaScript developer. Before moving to Gothenburg I was living in Växjö programming in PHP and JavaScript. I used to study at Linnaeus University back in 2010-2012.

The reason I'm taking the course is to broaden my JavaScript horizon.

##Expectations
I'm looking forward to learning functional programming.

##My JavaScript today
I see it as good/very good. Everything's solveable and for the rest there's Google and StackOverflow. Maybe I've forgotten some of the vanilla JS while using frameworks such as BackbonJS and AngularJS but most of it's up there somewhere in my head.

##Editor
PHPStorm for PHP, Netbeans or Eclipse for Java. JavaScript in the same editor that I'm writing the backend language for the current project. Sublime Text for "quick things".
